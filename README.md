# Cameron Anderson

Full-stack engineer building AI systems across computer vision, NLP, quantitative finance, and cognitive architectures. I ship production software — from iOS apps on the App Store to GPU-accelerated video pipelines to self-evolving neural systems.

## Featured Projects

### [ION](https://github.com/cameronsaddress/ION) - Tri-Cameral Cognitive Architecture
Biologically-inspired AI with 20+ neural subsystems (hippocampus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex), a 12-stage autonomous self-evolution pipeline, and epistemic reasoning engine. Routes queries through three processing layers with complexity-based switching. 96K+ LOC.

**Python, FastAPI, React, Three.js, RWKV-6, DeepSeek, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Docker**

### [AI_Trader](https://github.com/cameronsaddress/AI_Trader) - Multi-Agent Crypto Trading Platform
6 competing LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek, Qwen) trade in parallel with isolated accounts. High-frequency Rust engine runs 8 quantitative strategies on Polymarket with Black-Scholes pricing and Kelly criterion sizing.

**Rust, Node.js, React, Python, XGBoost, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker**

### [Pole_Locations](https://github.com/cameronsaddress/Pole_Locations) - AI Utility Pole Verification
Automates FCC infrastructure inspections using dual-expert YOLO11l, OpenAI CLIP, Grounding DINO, and PostGIS sensor fusion across satellite, street-level, and LiDAR data sources.

**Python, FastAPI, React, YOLO, CLIP, PostGIS, Docker**

### [TrainFlow_AI](https://github.com/cameronsaddress/TrainFlow_AI) - Enterprise Training Content Generator
Transforms raw field video into structured training guides using NeMo Parakeet ASR, YOLOv8 visual analysis, and LLM reasoning with 2M-token context windows.

**Python, FastAPI, Next.js, NeMo, YOLOv8, PostgreSQL, Docker**

### [RealContent_AI](https://github.com/cameronsaddress/RealContent_AI) - AI Video Content Pipeline
9-stage automated pipeline: scraping, transcription, LLM analysis, avatar generation, GPU-accelerated rendering with FFmpeg NVENC, and multi-platform publishing.

**Python, FastAPI, React, Celery, FFmpeg, Docker**

### [What_If](https://github.com/cameronsaddress/What_If) - AI Life-Path Simulator
Explores alternate outcomes of major life decisions using multi-model LLM reasoning through OpenRouter (Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash), real-world probability data across 6 decision categories, and an interactive "River of Destiny" SVG visualization.

**Python, Streamlit, OpenRouter, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, svgwrite**

### [SnapChef](https://github.com/cameronsaddress/SnapChef) - iOS Recipe App (Live on App Store)
Photograph your fridge, get personalized meal suggestions. Multi-provider LLM backend with Gemini and GPT fallback.

**Swift, SwiftUI, FastAPI, Gemini, GPT** | [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapchef/id6749384208)
